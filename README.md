# JavaScript-Challenge-Quiz
Timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals

## Description of work performed

I had to write, from scratch, html and CSS powered by Javascript code to create a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals.

- Created basic syntax to get the browser to display a quiz with timer.
- Added three true/false questions to be answered with a clickable button.


Learned to link JS script pages to HTML document, as well as creating event timers and creating time interval variables.
